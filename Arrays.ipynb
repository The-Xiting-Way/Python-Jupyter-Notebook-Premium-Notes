    "Lists are built into the Python programming language, whereas arrays aren't. Arrays are not a built-in data structure, and therefore need to be imported via the array module in order to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays of the array module are a thin wrapper over C arrays, and are useful when you want to work with homogeneous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are also more compact and take up less memory and space which makes them more size efficient compared to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to perform mathematical calculations, then you should use NumPy arrays by importing the NumPy package. Besides that, you should just use Python arrays when you really need to, as lists work in a similar way and are more flexible to work with."
